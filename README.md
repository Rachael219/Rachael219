# Hi 👋, I'm [Rachael Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachael-evans-65a44a169/)

I am a data analyst and informatician working at NHSX based in London👩‍💼. 

I studied Politics at the University of York 🎓 and so I'm new to the world tech 🖥️. **But keen to learn!** 

Whilst I complete an informatics degree at UCL I want to improve my basic R skills. I am also interested in becoming part of Women Coding networks!
